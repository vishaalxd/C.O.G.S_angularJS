        The church’s mission is threefold:
        To establish and maintain a place of worship of the Almighty God our heavenly Father, and of the
        Lord
        Jesus Christ, God’s only begotten Son, and of the Holy Spirit
        To promote Christian fellowship and edification
        To obey the great commission
